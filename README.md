# Sorting-Algorithms-in-C

Some sorting algorithms implemented in C and Cpp
A simple repository management problem is used as an example

## Bubble Sort:
Sometimes referred to as sinking sort, is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted. The algorithm, which is a comparison sort, is named for the way smaller or larger elements "bubble" to the top of the list.
Bubble sort has a worst-case and average complexity of О(n2), where n is the number of items being sorted. Most practical sorting algorithms have substantially better worst-case or average complexity, often O(n log n). Even other О(n2) sorting algorithms, such as insertion sort, generally run faster than bubble sort, and are no more complex. Therefore, bubble sort is not a practical sorting algorithm.
